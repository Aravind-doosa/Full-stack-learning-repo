<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I hold a BSc in Computer Science and am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Applications (MCA). 
  During my academic journey, I have immersed myself in the world of programming, with a particular focus on Python.</p>

  <p>My hands-on experience was further enriched through a rewarding internship at Code Way, where I delved into Python programming, honing my skills and gaining practical insights into real-world projects. This experience not only strengthened my technical proficiency but also deepened my passion for coding.</p>
  
  <p>Beyond academics and work, I actively seek opportunities for continuous learning, staying abreast of the latest developments in technology. I thrive on challenges and have a proven track record of overcoming obstacles, turning them into opportunities for growth.</p>
  
 <p> My journey in computer science is driven by a genuine curiosity and a commitment to contributing meaningfully to the ever-evolving tech landscape. As I continue my education and exploration in Python Full Stack Development, I look forward to leveraging my skills, experiences, and enthusiasm to make a positive impact in the field</p>
